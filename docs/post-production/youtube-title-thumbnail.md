# YouTube Title & Thumbnail Development

**Status**: Exploration phase - not finalized

## Title Finalists

### Option A (Singular, Demo-focused)
> **"BMAD + Claude SDK: Build an App, that Builds Itself"**

**Pros:**
- Concrete, specific demo
- Storytelling angle (follow one app's journey)
- "an App" feels more approachable/achievable

**Cons:**
- Could seem like one-off trick vs. repeatable pattern

---

### Option B (Plural, Pattern-focused) ⭐ CURRENT FAVORITE
> **"BMAD + Claude SDK: Building Apps that Build Themselves"**

**Pros:**
- Suggests repeatable pattern/framework
- "Apps" (plural) implies broader capability
- More generalizable (not just this one demo)
- Sounds like a methodology you can learn

**Cons:**
- Slightly less punchy than "an App"
- Could feel more abstract

---

**Recommendation: Option B** if you want to emphasize this as a **learnable pattern**.
**Recommendation: Option A** if you want to emphasize **following a specific journey**.

Both work. B might have slight edge for developer audience who want "how to do this myself."

## Alternative Variations (Archived)

- "The App That Builds Itself: BMAD + Claude SDK Demo"
- "BMAD Method + Claude SDK: Self-Building Applications"
- "Self-Modifying Apps with BMAD + Claude SDK"
- "Context Engineering vs Vibe Coding: Building Apps That Build Themselves"
- "From Exploration to Production: BMAD + Claude SDK"

## Thumbnail Concepts

### Option A - Split Screen
```
Left: Person typing in text box (casual)
Right: Complex app UI appearing
Text overlay: "Builds Itself"
```

### Option B - Recursive Visual
```
Screen showing app
→ App showing code editor
→ Code editor showing app
Text: "Build an App, that Builds Itself"
BMAD + Claude SDK logos
```

### Option C - Before/After
```
Before: Empty text box
After: Full product catalog site
Arrow: "Just by Talking"
```

### Option D - Two Paradigms
```
Split down middle:
Left half: CONTEXT ENGINEERING (blueprint, structured, blue)
Right half: VIBE CODING (paint palette, exploratory, purple)
Center: CLAUDE SKILLS bridge icon
Bottom: "Building Apps that Build Themselves"
```

**Note**: Thumbnail must convey "self-modification" visually

## Title Testing Strategy

If you want to A/B test titles (future):

1. Upload as unlisted with Title A
2. Share with small audience (Discord, Twitter)
3. Check CTR after 48 hours
4. Re-upload with Title B to different audience
5. Compare engagement metrics

Or use YouTube's built-in A/B testing (if available for your channel size).

## Further Exploration Needed

- **Hook opening** (first 10 seconds script)
- **Description template** (SEO-optimized)
- **Chapter markers** (for YouTube timeline)
- **End screen suggestions** (next video to watch)
- **Playlist positioning** (where does this fit?)
- **Community post strategy** (pre-launch hype)

---

## Notes

- Don't finalize until content is fully scripted
- Thumbnail should match actual demo (not misleading)
- Title should pass "mom test" (would my mom understand what this is about?)
- Consider series potential (if this is #1, what's #2?)
