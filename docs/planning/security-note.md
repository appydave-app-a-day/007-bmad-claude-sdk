# Security Note (V1 Video)

**Quick disclaimer for the video:**

> ⚠️ **This is educational demo code** - great for local development, MVPs, and learning, but not production-ready without significant security hardening (authentication, input validation, sandboxing, monitoring). Perfect for exploring what's possible with Claude SDK, not what's advisable for untrusted users.

**For detailed security analysis**: See `v2/security-considerations.md` (future video topic)
