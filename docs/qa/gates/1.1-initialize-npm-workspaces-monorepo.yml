final_verdict: |
  Story 1.1 delivers TEXTBOOK infrastructure setup. This is exactly what a foundational
  monorepo story should look like:

  - Perfect architectural alignment
  - TypeScript 5.7.2 with strict mode
  - Clean NPM workspaces with proper scoping
  - Type sharing pattern established
  - Zero technical debt
  - All 9 acceptance criteria validated with evidence

  EXCELLENT WORK. Ready for production.
