# Scratch / Exploratory Tests

Temporary testing scripts and investigation notes that don't belong in main docs or implementation.

## Files

- `test-sdk.ts` - Minimal SDK validation test (run with: `npx tsx scratch/test-sdk.ts`)
- `test-streaming.md` - Analysis of streaming behavior with Claude Agent SDK

## Purpose

This folder contains:
- Quick validation scripts
- Exploratory tests
- Investigation notes
- Ad-hoc debugging tools

These files are for development exploration and can be safely ignored during implementation.

## Usage

Run the SDK test:
```bash
npx tsx scratch/test-sdk.ts
```

Read streaming analysis:
```bash
cat scratch/test-streaming.md
```
